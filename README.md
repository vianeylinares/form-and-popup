# Form and popup

This project goal was to create a custom WordPress plugin that would display in the frontend a newsletter form, including a privacy policy acceptance checkbox. If the user checks the checkbox, the popup activates and shows the privacy policy text.

There are no options to set up in WP admin. This plugin was developed to be used with custom HTML newsletter forms provided by different CRM systems. The newsletter forms are placed manually and directly in the source code.
